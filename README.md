# Flappy Bird in React + Vite

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, built using **React** and **Vite** for optimal performance and fast development.

## About the Game

Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging game where players control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes by tapping to make it flap. The goal is to survive as long as possible without hitting obstacles. The game features:

- Smooth physics-based bird movement
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles
- Scoring system to track progress
- Simple but addictive gameplay

## Technologies Used

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
